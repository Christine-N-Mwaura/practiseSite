         <h3>About parrots in general</h3>
         <p>Parrots are colorful birds that are found all over the world.
             They range in weight from less than an ounce to as much as nine pounds.
             Those that are native to South America, Central America and Mexico are called New World parrots while the ones in Asia, Africa and Australia are Old World parrots and sometimes have powdery feathers.
             There are more than 300 species in the world today, though sadly, some of them are endangered.</p>
         <h3>Fun facts about Pikachu and his friends</h3>
            <ul>
               <li>Many parrots can imitate sounds.</li>
                 <iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ldYkFdu5FJk"></iframe>
                 <p>Above was a short of clip of my friend Winnie training Alex. In homes, parrots can copy the sounds of a phone ringing, a vacuum cleaner humming, water running, the doorbell chiming and other sounds. Of course, they can imitate human speech, too.
                       They do this because they think these sounds are made by their flock and, therefore, they have to learn them.</p>
               <li>Many parrots mate for life.</li>
                 <img src="images/Lovebirds.jpg">
                 <p>In order to find a mate, a male parrot puts on what is called a courtship display, parading itself, dancing or making various expressions and sounds to attract the female.
                   Once the female chooses him, the two stay together for life, even outside the breeding season.
                   They help each other find food, watch out for each other, sleep together and groom each other in order to strengthen their bond. Lovebirds are especially known for their tight bond since they spend long hours just sitting together on a perch</p>
               <li>Cockatoos can move the feathers on their heads</li>
                 <img src="images/sulphur-crested-cockatoo.jpg" alt="Image of a cookatoo parrot">
                 <p>Cockatoos are Old World parrots that are often not as brightly colored as other parrots.
                   Their feathers lack the chemicals that are responsible for the blue and green colors found in other parrots, so they do not have these colors.
                   Their most distinguishing feature is their headcrest or the feathers on their head which, interestingly, they can move just as dogs can move their ears</p>
               <li>The world’s largest parrot cannot fly.</li>
                 <img src="images/kakapo.jpg">
                 <p>The kakapo is the world’s largest parrot. It can weigh up to nine pounds and grow over two feet long.
                   The kakapo, however, is a flightless bird. It cannot fly. In fact, it is the only flightless parrot in the world.
                   It is also the only parrot that is active at night, an adaptation that helps it escape the notice of predators.</p>
